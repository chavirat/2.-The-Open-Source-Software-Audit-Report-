Results include a listing of open source packages identified and their associated open source license(s).  For all common licenses we have provided analysis summarizing license obligations.  Also, we indicate files catagorized under other non open source software models (such as freeware, commercial, or in-house software).","Disclaim1":"Rogue Wave Software, Inc. is not engaged in the rendering of legal advice.

Freeware, and In-House software is catagorized as Proprietary Licensing.\n\nDual, or multiple licenses options:\nSome software packages offer multiple licenses to choose from. Choices types are:\n         * disjunctive:  choice of licenses (either\/or)\n         * conjunctive:  no choice, all licenses apply (all\/and)\n         * single:  no choice, one license identified\n\n      Typically, for disjunctive license choices, the most permissive is chosen (as reflected on BOM tab,  LIcense Option1)  and the alternative license(s) are usually offered to accomidate license compatibility, or potential conflicts between licenses.\n\nLicense Option1:\n       If License choice Type is disjunctive, License Option1 is most permissive option available.\n       if conjunctive, all licenses (or the least permissive) are listed under License Option1.","HelpCVE":"<pre>CVE Terminology and FAQ\nWhat is CVE?\nCVE is a list of information security vulnerabilities and exposures that aims to provide common names for publicly known problems. The goal of CVE is to make it easier to share data across separate vulnerability capabilities (tools, repositories, and services) with this \"common enumeration.\" Please visit http:\/\/cve.mitre.org\/about\/faqs.html for more information\n\nWhat is a \"Vulnerability?\"\nAn information security \"vulnerability\" is a mistake in software that can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.\n\nWhat is an \"Exposure?\"\nAn information security exposure is a mistake in software that allows access to information or capabilities that can be used by a hacker as a stepping-stone into a system or network.\n\nWhat is a CVE Identifier?\nCVE Identifiers (also called \"CVE names,\" \"CVE numbers,\" \"CVE-IDs,\" and \"CVEs\") are unique, common identifiers for publicly known information security vulnerabilities. Each CVE Identifier includes the following: \n- CVE identifier number (i.e., \"CVE-1999-0067\"). \n- Indication of \"entry\" or \"candidate\" status. \n- Brief description of the security vulnerability or exposure. \n- Any pertinent references (i.e., vulnerability reports and advisories or OVAL-ID). \n- CVE Identifiers are used by information security product\/service vendors and researchers as a standard method for identifying vulnerabilities and for cross-linking with other repositories that also use CVE Identifiers.\n\nWho owns CVE?\nThe MITRE Corporation maintains CVE and cvedetails.com public Web site, manages the compatibility program, and provides impartial technical guidance to the CVE Editorial Board throughout the process to ensure CVE serves the public interest.
