Modified Versions.          <br>When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.<\/p>              <p><strong>5.

By  contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your  freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it  remains free software for all its users.<\/p>    <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you  want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new  free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<\/p>    <p>Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights  with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer  you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute  and\/or modify the software.<\/p>    <p>A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that  improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they  receive widespread use, become available for other developers to  incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and  encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of  software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.  The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and  letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its  source code to the public.<\/p>    <p>The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to  ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available  to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to  provide the source code of the modified version running there to the  users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on  a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source  code of the modified version.<\/p>    <p>An older license, called the Affero General Public License and  published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is  a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has  released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under  this license.<\/p>    <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  modification follow.<\/p>    <h3><a name=\"terms\"><\/a>TERMS AND CONDITIONS<\/h3>    <h4><a name=\"section0\"><\/a>0. Definitions.<\/h4>    <p>'This License' refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public  License.<\/p>    <p>'Copyright' also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds  of works, such as semiconductor masks.<\/p>    <p>'The Program' refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this  License.  Each licensee is addressed as 'you'.  'Licensees' and  'recipients' may be individuals or organizations.<\/p>    <p>To 'modify' a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work  in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an  exact copy.  The resulting work is called a 'modified version' of the  earlier work or a work 'based on' the earlier work.<\/p>    <p>A 'covered work' means either the unmodified Program or a work based  on the Program.<\/p>    <p>To 'propagate' a work means to do anything with it that, without  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a  computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the  public, and in some countries other activities as well.<\/p>    <p>To 'convey' a work means any kind of propagation that enables other  parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through  a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<\/p>    <p>An interactive user interface displays 'Appropriate Legal Notices'  to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible  feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)  tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the  extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the  work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If  the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a  menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<\/p>    <h4><a name=\"section1\"><\/a>1. Source Code.<\/h4>    <p>The 'source code' for a work means the preferred form of the work  for making modifications to it.  'Object code' means any non-source  form of a work.<\/p>    <p>A 'Standard Interface' means an interface that either is an official  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that  is widely used among developers working in that language.<\/p>    <p>The 'System Libraries' of an executable work include anything, other  than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of  packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major  Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that  Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an  implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A  'Major Component', in this context, means a major essential component  (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system  (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to  produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<\/p>    <p>The 'Corresponding Source' for a work in object code form means all  the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable  work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to  control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's  System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free  programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but  which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source  includes interface definition files associated with source files for  the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically  linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,  such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those  subprograms and other parts of the work.<\/p>    <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users  can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding  Source.<\/p>    <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that  same work.<\/p>    <h4><a name=\"section2\"><\/a>2. Basic Permissions.<\/h4>    <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated  conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited  permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a  covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its  content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your  rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<\/p>    <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not  convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains  in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose  of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you  with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with  the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do  not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works  for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction  and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of  your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<\/p>    <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under  the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10  makes it unnecessary.<\/p>    <h4><a name=\"section3\"><\/a>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<\/h4>    <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article  11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or  similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such  measures.<\/p>    <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid  circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention  is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to  the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or  modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's  users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of  technological measures.<\/p>    <h4><a name=\"section4\"><\/a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<\/h4>    <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;  keep intact all notices stating that this License and any  non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;  keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all  recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<\/p>    <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,  and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<\/p>    <h4><a name=\"section5\"><\/a>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<\/h4>    <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the  terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<\/p>    <ul>    <li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified      it, and giving a relevant date.<\/li>    <li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is      released under this License and any conditions added under section      7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to      'keep intact all notices'.<\/li>    <li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this      License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This      License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7      additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,      regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no      permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not      invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<\/li>    <li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your      work need not make them do so.<\/li>    <\/ul>    <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent  works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,  and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,  in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an  'aggregate' if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not  used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users  beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work  in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other  parts of the aggregate.<\/p>    <h4><a name=\"section6\"><\/a>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<\/h4>    <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms  of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the  machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,  in one of these ways:<\/p>    <ul>    <li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium      customarily used for software interchange.<\/li>    <li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a      written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as      long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product      model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a      copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the      product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical      medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no      more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the      Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<\/li>    <li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This      alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and      only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord      with subsection 6b.<\/li>    <li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated      place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the      Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no      further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the      Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to      copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source      may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)      that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain      clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the      Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the      Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is      available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<\/li>    <li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided      you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding      Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no      charge under subsection 6d.<\/li>    <\/ul>    <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be  included in conveying the object code work.<\/p>    <p>A 'User Product' is either (1) a 'consumer product', which means any  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,  or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation  into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,  doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular  product received by a particular user, 'normally used' refers to a  typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status  of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user  actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product  is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial  commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent  the only significant mode of use of the product.<\/p>    <p>'Installation Information' for a User Product means any methods,  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install  and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from  a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must  suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object  code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because  modification has been made.<\/p>    <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or  specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as  part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the  User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a  fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the  Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied  by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply  if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install  modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has  been installed in ROM).<\/p>    <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a  requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates  for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for  the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a  network may be denied when the modification itself materially and  adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and  protocols for communication across the network.<\/p>    <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,  in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly  documented (and with an implementation available to the public in  source code form), and must require no special password or key for  unpacking, reading or copying.<\/p>    <h4><a name=\"section7\"><\/a>7. Additional Terms.<\/h4>    <p>'Additional permissions' are terms that supplement the terms of this  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall  be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent  that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions  apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately  under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by  this License without regard to the additional permissions.<\/p>    <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option  remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of  it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own  removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place  additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,  for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<\/p>    <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you  add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of  that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<\/p>    <ul>    <li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<\/li>    <li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or      author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal      Notices displayed by works containing it; or<\/li>    <li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in      reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<\/li>    <li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or      authors of the material; or<\/li>    <li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some      trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<\/li>    <li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that      material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of      it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for      any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on      those licensors and authors.<\/li>    <\/ul>    <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered 'further  restrictions' within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you  received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is  governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,  you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further  restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you  may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license  document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such  relicensing or conveying.<\/p>    <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you  must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the  additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating  where to find the applicable terms.<\/p>    <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the  form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;  the above requirements apply either way.<\/p>    <h4><a name=\"section8\"><\/a>8. Termination.<\/h4>    <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly  provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under  this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third  paragraph of section 11).<\/p>    <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)  provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and  finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright  holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means  prior to 60 days after the cessation.<\/p>    <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after  your receipt of the notice.<\/p>    <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under  this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same  material under section 10.<\/p>    <h4><a name=\"section9\"><\/a>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<\/h4>    <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or  run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,  nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or  modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do  not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a  covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<\/p>    <h4><a name=\"section10\"><\/a>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<\/h4>    <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically  receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and  propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<\/p>    <p>An 'entity transaction' is a transaction transferring control of an  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an  organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered  work results from an entity transaction, each party to that  transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever  licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could  give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the  Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if  the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<\/p>    <p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the  rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may  not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of  rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that  any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for  sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<\/p>    <h4><a name=\"section11\"><\/a>11. Patents.<\/h4>    <p>A 'contributor' is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The  work thus licensed is called the contributor's 'contributor version'.<\/p>    <p>A contributor's 'essential patent claims' are all patent claims  owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or  hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted  by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,  but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a  consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For  purposes of this definition, 'control' includes the right to grant  patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of  this License.<\/p>    <p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to  make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and  propagate the contents of its contributor version.<\/p>    <p>In the following three paragraphs, a 'patent license' is any express  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent  (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to  sue for patent infringement).  To 'grant' such a patent license to a  party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a  patent against the party.<\/p>    <p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,  and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone  to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a  publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,  then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so  available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the  patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner  consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent  license to downstream recipients.  'Knowingly relying' means you have  actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the  covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work  in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that  country that you have reason to believe are valid.<\/p>    <p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or  arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a  covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties  receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify  or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license  you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered  work and works based on it.<\/p>    <p>A patent license is 'discriminatory' if it does not include within  the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is  conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are  specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered  work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is  in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment  to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying  the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the  parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory  patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work  conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily  for and in connection with specific products or compilations that  contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,  or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<\/p>    <p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting  any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may  otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<\/p>    <h4><a name=\"section12\"><\/a>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<\/h4>    <p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a  covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may  not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you  to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey  the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this  License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<\/p>    <h4><a name=\"section13\"><\/a>13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.<\/h4>    <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the  Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users  interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version  supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding  Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source  from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary  means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source  shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3  of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the  following paragraph.<\/p>    <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission  to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3  of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to  convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to  apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is  combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public  License.<\/p>    <h4><a name=\"section14\"><\/a>14. Revised Versions of this License.<\/h4>    <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of  the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ  in detail to address new problems or concerns.<\/p>    <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the  Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero  General Public License 'or any later version' applies to it, you have  the option of following the terms and conditions either of that  numbered version or of any later version published by the Free  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number  of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version  ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<\/p>    <p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future  versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that  proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently  authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.<\/p>    <p>Later license versions may give you additional or different  permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any  author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a  later version.<\/p>    <h4><a name=\"section15\"><\/a>15.

It is safest  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  the 'copyright' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<\/p>    <pre>    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;      Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and\/or modify      it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as      published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the      License, or (at your option) any later version.        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the      GNU Affero General Public License for more details.        You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License      along with this program.

For example, if your program is a web application, its  interface could display a 'Source' link that leads users to an archive  of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different  solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the  specific requirements.<\/p>    <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,  if any, to sign a 'copyright disclaimer' for the program, if necessary.

By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.<\/p>  <p> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<\/p>  <p> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<\/p>  <p> For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.<\/p>  <p> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the software.<\/p>  <p> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.<\/p>  <p> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<\/p>  <p> GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<\/p>  <p> 0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The 'Program', below, refers to any such program or work, and a 'work based on the Program' means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as 'you'.<\/p>  <p> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.<\/p>  <p> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:<\/p>  <p> a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that  you changed the files and the date of any change; and<\/p>  <p> b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that  in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either  with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all  third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except  that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all  third parties, at your option).<\/p>  <p> c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when  run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use  in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an  announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice  that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a  warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these  conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General  Public License.<\/p>  <p> d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in  exchange for a fee.<\/p>  <p>Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.<\/p>  <p> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<\/p>  <p> a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of  Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,<\/p>  <p> b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three  years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge  for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the  corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of  Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,<\/p>  <p> c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the  corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is  allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you  received the program in object code or executable form alone.)<\/p>  <p>Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.<\/p>  <p> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<\/p>  <p> 5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.<\/p>  <p> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<\/p>  <p> 7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<\/p>  <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and 'any later version', you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<\/p>  <p> 8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<\/p>  <p> NO WARRANTY<\/p>  <p> 9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<\/p>  <p> 10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND\/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<\/p>  <p> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<\/p>  <p> Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<\/p>  <p> If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<\/p>  <p> To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.

If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.

Distribution of Executable Versions.&#13;<br\/>&#13;You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.

It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]<\/pre><h3><a id=\"SEC2\">Preamble<\/a><\/h3><p>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away yourfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General PublicLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and changefree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<\/p><p>  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to somespecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of theFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  Youcan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whetherthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the betterstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<\/p><p>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure thatyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and chargefor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can getit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces ofit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can dothese things.<\/p><p>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbiddistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender theserights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities foryou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<\/p><p>  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gaveyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the sourcecode.  If you link other code with the library, you must providecomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink themwith the library after making changes to the library and recompilingit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<\/p><p>  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright thelibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legalpermission to copy, distribute and\/or modify the library.<\/p><p>  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear thatthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library ismodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should knowthat what they have is not the original version, so that the originalauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might beintroduced by others.<\/p><p>  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence ofany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannoteffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining arestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist thatany patent license obtained for a version of the library must beconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<\/p><p>  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by theordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU LesserGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, andis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We usethis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking thoselibraries into non-free programs.<\/p><p>  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or usinga shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking acombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinaryGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if theentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser GeneralPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code withthe library.<\/p><p>  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because itdoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary GeneralPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Lessof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantagesare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for manylibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certainspecial circumstances.<\/p><p>  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need toencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomesa de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must beallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a freelibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In thiscase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to freesoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<\/p><p>  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-freeprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body offree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library innon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNUoperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU\/Linux operatingsystem.<\/p><p>  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of theusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that islinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to runthat program using a modified version of the Library.<\/p><p>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  Theformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter mustbe combined with the library in order to run.<\/p><h3><a id=\"SEC3\">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<\/a><\/h3><p><strong>0.<\/strong>This License Agreement applies to any software library or otherprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder orother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms ofthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".<\/p><p>  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\/or dataprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<\/p><p>  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or workwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on theLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work undercopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or aportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\/or translatedstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation isincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)<\/p><p>  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work formaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code meansall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associatedinterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilationand installation of the library.<\/p><p>  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are notcovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act ofrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output fromsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work basedon the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool forwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library doesand what the program that uses the Library does.<\/p><p><strong>1.<\/strong>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library'scomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided thatyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy anappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intactall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of anywarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with theLibrary.<\/p><p>  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for afee.<\/p><p><strong>2.<\/strong>You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<\/p><ul>  <li><strong>a)<\/strong>       The modified work must itself be a software library.<\/li>  <li><strong>b)<\/strong>       You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<\/li>  <li><strong>c)<\/strong>       You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<\/li>  <li><strong>d)<\/strong>       If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,       in the event an application does not supply such function or       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of       its purpose remains meaningful.       <p>       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has       a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the       application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any       application-supplied function or table used by this function must       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square       root function must still compute square roots.)<\/p><\/li><\/ul><p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiablesections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can bereasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, thenthis License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when youdistribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the samesections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, thedistribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whosepermissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus toeach and every part regardless of who wrote it.<\/p><p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest yourrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercisethe right to control the distribution of derivative or collective worksbased on the Library.<\/p><p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library withthe Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storageor distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope ofthis License.<\/p><p><strong>3.<\/strong>You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General PublicLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To dothis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, sothat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of theordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specifythat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change inthese notices.<\/p><p>  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible forthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to allsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<\/p><p>  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code ofthe Library into a program that is not a library.<\/p><p><strong>4.<\/strong>You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion orderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable formunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompanyit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, whichmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on amedium customarily used for software interchange.<\/p><p>  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy thesource code from the same place satisfies the requirement todistribute the source code, even though third parties are notcompelled to copy the source along with the object code.<\/p><p><strong>5.<\/strong>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of theLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled orlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such awork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, andtherefore falls outside the scope of this License.<\/p><p>  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Librarycreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because itcontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses thelibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<\/p><p>  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header filethat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be aderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can belinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  Thethreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<\/p><p>  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, datastructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inlinefunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the objectfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivativework.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of theLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)<\/p><p>  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you maydistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<\/p><p><strong>6.<\/strong>As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine orlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce awork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that workunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permitmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverseengineering for debugging such modifications.<\/p><p>  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that theLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered bythis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the workduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include thecopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a referencedirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do oneof these things:<\/p><ul>    <li><strong>a)<\/strong> Accompany the work with the complete    corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library    including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be    distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an    executable linked with the Library, with the complete    machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code    and\/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and    then relink to produce a modified executable containing the    modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the    contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily    be able to recompile the application to use the modified    definitions.)<\/li>    <li><strong>b)<\/strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism    for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that    (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the    user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into    the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified    version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the    modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the    work was made with.<\/li>    <li><strong>c)<\/strong> Accompany the work with a written offer,    valid for at least three years, to give the same user the    materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more    than the cost of performing this distribution.<\/li>    <li><strong>d)<\/strong> If distribution of the work is made by    offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent    access to copy the above specified materials from the same    place.<\/li>    <li><strong>e)<\/strong> Verify that the user has already received    a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user    a copy.<\/li><\/ul><p>  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses theLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed forreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,the materials to be distributed need not include anything that isnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the majorcomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system onwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompaniesthe executable.<\/p><p>  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the licenserestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normallyaccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannotuse both them and the Library together in an executable that youdistribute.<\/p><p><strong>7.<\/strong> You may place library facilities that are a workbased on the Library side-by-side in a single library together withother library facilities not covered by this License, and distributesuch a combined library, provided that the separate distribution ofthe work based on the Library and of the other library facilities isotherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<\/p><ul>    <li><strong>a)<\/strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy    of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other    library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of    the Sections above.<\/li>    <li><strong>b)<\/strong> Give prominent notice with the combined    library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the    Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined    form of the same work.<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>8.<\/strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under thisLicense.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, linkwith, or distribute the Library is void, and will automaticallyterminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who havereceived copies, or rights, from you under this License will not havetheir licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in fullcompliance.<\/p><p><strong>9.<\/strong>You are not required to accept this License, since you have notsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify ordistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions areprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, bymodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, andall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifyingthe Library or works based on it.<\/p><p><strong>10.<\/strong>Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from theoriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Librarysubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any furtherrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties withthis License.<\/p><p><strong>11.<\/strong>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannotdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thisLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence youmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patentlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library byall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, thenthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be torefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<\/p><p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under anyparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<\/p><p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe anypatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of anysuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting theintegrity of the free software distribution system which isimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have madegenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributedthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of thatsystem; it is up to the author\/donor to decide if he or she is willingto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannotimpose that choice.<\/p><p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed tobe a consequence of the rest of this License.<\/p><p><strong>12.<\/strong>If the distribution and\/or use of the Library is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, theoriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may addan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thusexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as ifwritten in the body of this License.<\/p><p><strong>13.<\/strong>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and\/or newversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<\/p><p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Libraryspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms andconditions either of that version or of any later version published bythe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify alicense version number, you may choose any version ever published bythe Free Software Foundation.<\/p><p><strong>14.<\/strong>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other freeprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which iscopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the FreeSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Ourdecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free statusof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharingand reuse of software generally.<\/p><p><strong>NO WARRANTY<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>15.<\/strong>BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NOWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND\/OROTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANYKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE.
